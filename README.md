# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-4-Degrees-of-Freedom-DOF-Robotic-Arm
This project involves building a 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm controlled wirelessly via NRF24L01 modules and an MPU6050 sensor based on hand gestures. The robotic arm's movements are based on input from flex sensors, push buttons, and accelerometer data obtained from hand gestures.
