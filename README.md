# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-4-Degrees-of-Freedom-DOF-Robotic-Arm
This project involves building a 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm controlled wirelessly via NRF24L01 modules and an MPU6050 sensor based on hand gestures. The robotic arm's movements are based on input from flex sensors, push buttons, and accelerometer data obtained from hand gestures.

## Features

- Wireless control using NRF24L01 modules.
- Real-time control based on hand gestures captured by the MPU6050 sensor.
- Flex sensor input for precise control over specific arm movements.
- Push button input for additional functionality.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- NRF24L01 modules (2)
- MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
- Flex sensor
- Push button
- Servo motors (4)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply
- 10k resistor (2)
